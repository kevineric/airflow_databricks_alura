# airflow_databricks_alura
Repository created to store do notebooks developed during the classes
It was a study project to learn more about two of the most popular tools in data area, air flow and databricks.

In this project, in resume, i develope a simple data pipeline.
I did the elt of interchange rate data, using databricks to process and store the files extracted, stored with medal rules (only bronze and silver rules was necessary here), plus i had to send a report to slack with some importantes results of this interchange rate.
Airflow was used to schedule the workflow.
